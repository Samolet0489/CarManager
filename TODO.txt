----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED!: right now on get_vehicle data it does not get the fuel consumption
so that we can see the fuel consumption

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
toilet brake:
rn the get is broken fix it.....!
IT took me half an hour of getting the same error coz I discarded the changes every time is dropped the table
TODO: SAVE THE CHANGES AFTER DROPPING THE TABLE TO ENSURE CLEAN TESTING!!!




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean up the required data so that we dont collect pointless stuff

officially claimed:
milage              - Added
fuel consumption    - Added
mechanic            - Pointless [removed]
owner               - Pointless [removed]
important dates = [] or {}

current:
self.id = id
self.name = name # here people can call their vehicle however they want
self.color = color  # people can set the exact color of the vehicle (in case of an accident the mechanic knows the paint)
self.expenses = expenses # total expenses (just adding up all expenses ever accumulated)
self.mileage = mileage
self.fuel_consumption = 0 # TODO: can you make it calculate it based on fill up data?
self.note = note # people can write a note with additional information about the car

data has been cleaned up: 17:38

there might be a massive problem with the fact that we might need

-frontend
--react data comes here
-backend
--src
---python back end


#get started on the basic react model for the front end. Good luck.

Lost the old todoFile for some reason

made a new one

dont really know what needs to be done.

TODO:redo the id system [MAKE SURE ITS INT]

flask is connected to the database

working with a midle file system and 2 servers

server 1 = react
server 2 = flask

s1 is connected to s2 with a middle (temp file folder)

s2 is the only one who gets to work with data
s1 only does the front end

##################################################################################
date unknown:

what if I just run the different methods as diffrent routes in the javascript

so this hell of a backend can just go away
